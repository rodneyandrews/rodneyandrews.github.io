This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>
<h3>Forklift Material Handling Fleming Island FL</h3>
<p>This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used.

The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
