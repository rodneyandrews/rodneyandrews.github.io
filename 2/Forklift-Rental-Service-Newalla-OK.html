<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable. Layman's Terms: This is a commonly used suspension lift component that does raise the truck, but doesn't add extra ground clearance for the underbelly.

<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>In reality if you go through all the trouble of lifting your truck you will also spend most of you paycheck on other parts to put on it.

The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
