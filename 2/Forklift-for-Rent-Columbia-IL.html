<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>When picking up loads, the reach truck moves its mast forward until the forks are positioned in front of the truck. The offered trucks are utilized for various material handling applications in a host of industries. These pallet trucks are manufactured using excellent quality raw material and newest technology by our qualified professionals. We are largest supplier and importer of Full Electric Pallet Truck.</p>
