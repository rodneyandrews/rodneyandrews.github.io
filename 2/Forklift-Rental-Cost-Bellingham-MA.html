<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
