We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>

Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
