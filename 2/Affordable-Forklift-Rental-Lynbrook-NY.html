<h3>Advanced Lift Truck News Lynbrook NY 11563</h3>
<p>Stone does not offer what would officially be labeled as rough-terrain forklifts, but does have industrial lift products that can be used both indoors and outdoors. So, whether you are carrying heavy cargo or travelling with a large family, the conversion trucks at Turner Chevrolet are what you need. No matter what you are interested in, we have a dedicated customer service team that is ready to guide you through the process of acquiring the lifted vehicle you need.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
