Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

Whatever your reasons for looking for a forklift rental near me”, Altorfer Lift Truck has the equipment you need to get the job done right. A more fuel efficient lift truck may save more than the monthly payment of the used forklift for sale.</p>
