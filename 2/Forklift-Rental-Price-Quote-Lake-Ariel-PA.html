The TAWI Mobile Order Picker is a one-of-a-kind solution for mobile material handling and order picking from pallet racks. A lifted truck is a truck that has had its suspension altered to increase the height of the vehicle, and sometimes fitted with large wheels.</p>

<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be.
