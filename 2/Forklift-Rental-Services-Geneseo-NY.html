OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
