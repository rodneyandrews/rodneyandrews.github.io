<h2>Fork Truck Safety Bowdon</h2>

One of our most popular and material handling equipment in demand is Electric Pallet Trucks. Highly versatile low-lift pallet skid handler for loads 3,000 - 8,000lbs. The electric forklift is a forklift truck powered by an electric motor instead of an internal combustion (IC) engine using either rechargeable industrial batteries or external ways of conveying power.</p>

The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
