<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable.

If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>
