<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
