<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift. If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required. Counterbalance forklifts are a straightforward appliance that feature dual forks for heavy loads and bulky items.</p>
