<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The forklift's overhead guard will quickly pin or crush a jumping operator. There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way.

The product has been designed and manufactured for maximum load capacity.</p>
<h2>Electric Reach Truck Walnut</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Off-roading tests the limits of both your Jeep and you as a driver. There are extensive ranges of forklifts available which include pedestrian operated machines to heavy duty driver operated trucks. The special handle design offers protection for the operator's handle and makes raising loads and steering easier. These forklifts travel at high and fast speeds.

<p>A reliable alternative to the Stainless Lifter is the BT Lifter Galvanized LHM230G model with stainless steel axles and galvanized chassis and pump. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet.

Today, rough terrain forklifts are a common sight on construction projects. Another safety feature that an electric reach stacker offers is an emergency reversing device in the handle. A forklift is a type of powered industrial truck” covered by OSHA standards.</p>
<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
