<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde. Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>

<h2>Yale Fork Truck Wilmington</h2>

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor.

<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Industrial Reach Forklift Trucks, Industrial Counterbalance Forklifts, Rough Terrain Forklifts, Industrial Side Loader Forklifts, Telescopic Handler Forklifts and Pedestrian Operated Pallet Trucks are the different types of forklifts.

<p>Pallet jacks are cheap, small in size, and good for small loads. Purchasing a lifted truck can be somewhat difficult, because these rare vehicles are hard to come by in some locations. They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers. Pettibone: Based in the United States, Pettibone rough terrain equipment is the result of customer input, largely designed and developed based on marketing research collected from owners and operators.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
