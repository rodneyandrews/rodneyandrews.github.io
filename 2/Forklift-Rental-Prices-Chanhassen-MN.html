<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations.

<p>It will mean you can drive 99% of all forklift trucks in the UK. As you already have experience, and the training is shorter, the cost for this is less than the beginner training. These are hand-controlled lift trucks where the operator controls the machine using a steering tiller that has controls mounted on top. Seth Stafford Numerous makes and models with varying reach and load-lifting capacities can be found on residential sites today.</p>
