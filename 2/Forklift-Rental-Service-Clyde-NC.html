Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry.

Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

In addition, reach trucks offer versatile benefits in various tasks for industries such as manufacturing industries, shop floors, transportation hubs, warehouses, logistics, and factories, owing to their compact design as well as greater maneuverability capability.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
