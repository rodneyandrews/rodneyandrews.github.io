OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
