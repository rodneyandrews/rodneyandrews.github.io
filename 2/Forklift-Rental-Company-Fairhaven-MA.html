<p>We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model. Our Fork Lift Rental fleet is regularly updated with New Rental Equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. There are plenty of lift kits available in the market that differ in terms of how much they can raise your pickup. Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires. Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
