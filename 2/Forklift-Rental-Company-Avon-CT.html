The same is applicable for forklift trucks too. In the past decade, the number of reach trucks with mast heights over eight meters has increased considerably and even heights of 13 meters are no longer a rarity.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>

<p>Additionally, dealerships can warranty the work they do on their own vehicles - even lift kits. The capacity of a truck equipped with load carriage and forks, or with attachments is the maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center, which a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable, on 406 of this Standard, can lift to the maximum elevation of the load engaging means.</p>
