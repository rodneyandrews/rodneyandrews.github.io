<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification.

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
