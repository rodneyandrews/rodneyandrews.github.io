<h3>New Toyota Forklift Winchendon MA</h3>
<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>Our selection of rental equipment comes from leading brands that are trusted around the globe to deliver products that meet the highest quality standards. If you are looking to carry loads cross-country with a highly stable machine, then these forklifts are ideal. But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
