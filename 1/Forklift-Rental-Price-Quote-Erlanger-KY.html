They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool. A suspension lift is a more popular option and gives you more ground clearance than a body lift - it's the only way to get enough height for larger tires.</p>
