<h2>Lift Systems For All Needs Ashland </h2>

Note: Service calls are not officially logged until you hear back from an Eastern Lift Truck Co. employee. It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>

We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment.

Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
