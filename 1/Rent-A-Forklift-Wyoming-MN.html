Additionally, each of our counterbalance forklift trucks includes easy-to-use features common in every Cat lift truck and a range of optional extras to ensure you get the configuration best suited to your needs.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
