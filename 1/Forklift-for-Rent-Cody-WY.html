<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials.

Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself.
