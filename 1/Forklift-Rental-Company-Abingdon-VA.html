<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>

Relaxation will be given to women-driven vehicles and government vehicles,” Kerala police had said on Saturday. Like the 10,000 lb. truck before it, some manufacturers offer boxcar” style counterweights to lessen the machine's footprint.</p>
