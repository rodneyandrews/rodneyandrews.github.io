<p>From maintenance vehicles and scissor lifts to electric burden carriers, personnel carriers, utility and specialty vehicles, and other warehouse equipment , we have a wide selection of solutions available with short- or long-term rental agreements to meet your changing business needs while minimizing the impact on your budget. Construction, heavy industry and mining continue to take advantage of rough- and all-terrain forklifts, while construction and agriculture have discovered the versatility of telehandlers.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
