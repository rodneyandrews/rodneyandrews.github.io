Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck.

Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

Our electric Yale forklifts are perfect for improving uptime in any warehouse. For me, the back glass and top of my truck can be pretty difficult to reach by hand unless (even without a lift kit).

<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them.
