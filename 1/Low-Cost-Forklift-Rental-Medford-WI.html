ProLift also oversees normal wear & tear” forklift service repairs. To be fair, suspension lift kits are necessary in certain scenarios Demanding off-road trails, especially when racing, require larger tires and increased suspension travel.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
