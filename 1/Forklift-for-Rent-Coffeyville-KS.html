<p>The operation of this switch is designed so that movement of the forklift is not possible while the operator is stocking or picking product. While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them. This will provide them with the necessary certifications to be able to use forklifts legally in their job. Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
