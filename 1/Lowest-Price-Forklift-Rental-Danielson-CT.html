We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
