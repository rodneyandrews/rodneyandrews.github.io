<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>

<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money.

For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>

We handle all major brands, makes, models, years and everything from an electric pallet jack to larger trucks.
